# ImpactCent 🌍💙  
*A micro-donation DApp for social good on Base, supported by and featuring OLYM3 AI Hub*  

---

## 🌐 Vision  
We envision a world where **every cent matters** — where donations as small as $0.01 can create a ripple effect of meaningful change.  

With **ImpactCent**, we’re transforming the culture of giving by making charity **accessible, transparent, and viral** through blockchain technology.  

Backed by **OLYM3 AI Hub**, our mission is to empower individuals, regardless of financial capacity, to contribute to social good. Importantly, **OLYM3 AI Hub is not only a supporter but also the very first featured cause on ImpactCent**, channeling micro-donations into advancing **AI-powered education, research, and global community building**.  

> *“Empowering the next generation with AI and Web3, one cent at a time.”*

## ❓ Problem to Solve  
Despite the rise of digital giving, traditional donation platforms face three critical barriers:  

1. **High Minimum Donations**  
   - Most platforms (e.g., GoFundMe, ShareTheMeal) require $1+ minimums, excluding millions who wish to give smaller amounts.  

2. **Lack of Transparency**  
   - Donors rarely see how funds are allocated. Centralized platforms obscure transactions and delay fund delivery.  

3. **Limited Social Engagement**  
   - Charity apps lack viral sharing features, reducing community participation and awareness.  

These barriers leave massive untapped potential for **micro-donations** that could globally support causes if made **simple, transparent, and shareable**.

## 💡 How We Do It  

### **ImpactCent: Small Cents, Big Impact**  
ImpactCent is a **hybrid DApp** on Base mainnet that combines **sub-cent donations** with **social sharing** to maximize engagement and transparency.  

**Here’s how it works:**  

1. **Micro-Donations on Base**  
   - Users donate **$0.01, $0.05, or $0.10 in USDC**.  
   - The **first flagship cause is OLYM3 AI Hub**, directing contributions toward AI-driven education, research projects, and Web3 community development.  
   - Base’s near-zero fees make these ultra-small donations viable.  

2. **On-Chain Transparency**  
   - Using **Onchain Kit**, every donation is recorded publicly with donor wallet, amount, cause, and timestamp.  
   - Funds for OLYM3 AI Hub and other causes go **directly into their wallets**, eliminating intermediaries.  

3. **Social Sharing for Virality**  
   - After donating, users generate a **unique shareable link or QR code** to post on X or other platforms.  
   - Example:  
     > “I donated $0.01 to OLYM3 AI Hub on ImpactCent! Join me 👉 [impactcent.app/donate?cause=olym3aihub]”  
   - This creates a chain reaction of giving, amplifying community participation.  

4. **Seamless User Experience**  
   - Powered by **Minikit** for payments and **Onchain Kit** for wallet integration.  
   - Donation flow: **Connect Wallet → Choose Cause → Donate → Share** — all in a few clicks.
